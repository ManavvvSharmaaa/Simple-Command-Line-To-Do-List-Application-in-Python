How it works:
load_tasks(): Loads tasks from a JSON file. If the file doesn't exist, it returns an empty list.
save_tasks(): Saves tasks to a JSON file.
add_task(): Adds a new task to the list and saves the updated list to the file.
list_tasks(): Lists all tasks with their status (Done/Not Done).
complete_task(): Marks a task as complete based on its index and saves the updated list to the file.
delete_task(): Deletes a task based on its index and saves the updated list to the file.
main(): Provides a simple command-line interface to interact with the to-do list application.
To start use "python todo_list.py".
